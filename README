Some time ago I  saw a YouTube video by biologist cdk007, located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcAq9bmCeR0 that took basic clock parts, and using straight up competition, created clocks via evolution.

The work by cdk007 was a simulation designed in Matlab, and he challenged readers to redo the results in another language, just to show that this is not a feature of Matlab.  His implementation is in the Clock Evolution Functions folder.

I am going to redo his application in C++.  Since I don't speak Matlab, there are probably going to be quite a few differences in our implementations.

Here are the files, and brief description of them.

User headers
stdafx.h - header file containing all the other header files.
Clock.h - header file containing declarations of the clock class.

User Cpp files
Clock.cpp - contains code for the clock class.

Pre-built headers
iostream - handles terminal input and output
fstream - reads/writes to a file.  Contains iostream.

TODO:
Get program actually working.
Make multithreaded.
Make CUDA enabled.
Wrap in GUI.  QT is a good cross-platform GUI.
